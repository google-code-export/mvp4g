/**
 * This annotation allows to define a presenter for the framework.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * To define the presenter, you need to indicate the class of the view to inject in the presenter
 * thanks to the attribute <i>view</i>. The framework will automatically create one instance of the
 * view for each presenter.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * You can define the names of the presenter and/or the presenter view thanks to the optional
 * attribute <i>name</i> and <i>viewName</i>. If you don't give a name, the framework will generate
 * one.<br/>
 * It is recommended to affect a name only if needed.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * You can activate the multiple feature to create several instance of the same presenter. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * You can also use the async attribute to create a fragment for this presenter (or for a group of presenters).
